## Love Letters: Card Game For Two

The aim of this project proposal is to put forth the idea of bringing *Love Letters* to a virtual environment,
albiet with only two players.

**What will this virtual Love Letters do?** <br />
  Like other card games, this version of love letters will consisit of:
- 2 Players
- A deck of 16 cards
- 8 unique types of cards with differing abilities

**Who will use it?**<br />
  Virtual Love Letters removes the burdensome physical elements from the cardgame, making its fun
  more portable and conveniant. Thus, it mainly targets students and people interested in recreationl activities. 

**Why choose this project?**<br />
  Well, my school's Board Game Club was an increadibly memorable and important part of my adolescence, and it
  helped me nurture a passion for board games. I remember Love Letters to be one of the first games introduced 
  to the club and argubaly most popular, so I wanted to try to reintrodce it in a different form, as a way to spread
  the joy and share my experience. 

  Either way, I hope ***you***, the reader, enjoy this game and have as much fun playing as I did designing it!
